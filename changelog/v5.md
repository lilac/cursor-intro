# Add bonus slide

## Prompt

Add a new slide before the last "Thank you" slide, that shows some bonus to the viewers. Add reference links if possible.

- View the [leaked prompt](https://github.com/x1xhlol/system-prompts-and-models-of-ai-tools/blob/main/Cursor%20Prompts/Agent%20Prompt.txt) from cursor's agent mode, to understand in-depth how it works.
- This slide itself is also written in Cursor editor, and is co-edited by the cursor agent. You can view the [source code](https://github.com/lilac/cursor-intro) of this slide to see how I automate slide creation with AI.
